# Not-so-basic-CAD
Assignments: Sweeps and Lofts, A little practice

## Sweeps and Lofts

What it made: A candlestick and a bent nail

What I learned: How to use sweeps, lofts, and revolves on Solidworks

Struggles: The instructions were pretty vague, and I struggles with the candlestick because it was so curvy

## A Little Practice

What it made: a three peice box with a hole in the middle, and a wheel nut part

What I learned: How to shell out parts, and how to make an extruded circular patern

Struggles: This assignment wasn't very hard, there was just a lot of steps and peices to make
