# Not-so-basic-CAD
Assignments: Sweeps and Lofts, A little practice

## Sweeps and Lofts

What it made: A candlestick and a bent nail

What I learned: How to use sweeps, lofts, and revolves on Solidworks

Struggles: The instructions were pretty vague, and I struggles with the candlestick because it was so curvy
